# Driver Mapping

A workshop format to identify an effective response to a complex situation: organize start-ups, kick-off projects, tackle major impediments or opportunities, develop organizational structure to better enable the flow of value.

A \(small or large\) group identifies and clusters drivers, to then progress quickly from concept to action in smaller and self-organizing teams.
