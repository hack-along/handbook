# The three 7s

This exercise is meant to apply gratitude and forgiveness and positive reinforcement to oneself.

Take some time to think about it, then write down 7 things you are proud of yourself, 7 things you forgive yourself for and 7 things you want to commit yourself to. 

These sentences should be used as a daily mantra \(eg: speaking them to yourself once a day while looking at the mirror\).  
  
Repeat for at least a month, or for as long as necessary.
